# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Simple web app in flask using a sql database. There are 3 tables in use. One table for keeping track of users and hashed passwords, another keeps tracks of reviews, the isbn for the book which was reviewed and the username of the user reviewing said book. The last table keeps track of the books that were imported using import.py which imports the books.csv file. The first function which is defined checks the users and isbn for the current book and ensures the user has not already submitted a review. It is called a few times in the main book page so it made more sense to just define it once and call it when needed. The app has login and log out functionality and allows users to register by just providing a username and password. The password is hashed using passlib and stored in the users table. The api/<isbn> route uses the goodreads api and the data imported from books.csv to display the data in json format as listed in the project requirements. --
